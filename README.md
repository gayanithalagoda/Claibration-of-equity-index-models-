# Claibration-of-equity-index-models-
Calibration of a geometric brownian motion based equity index models in hidden Markov model setting
The code contains calibration of equity index models in a Hidden markov setting using Expectation Maximisation algorithm
Calibration is carried out for 2 state, 3 state and 4 state cases. 
The equity index is assumed to follow a Geometric Brownian Motion.
